GEM5_performance_benchmark

A project use 4 algorithms(basicmath, dijkstra, FFT, qsort) to benchmark the following 2 cache replacement policies:
- LRU
- self-implemented SRRIP 

Performance is evaluated based on cache miss rate and execution time, with fixed cache size, associativity and cache line size.
